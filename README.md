ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jason, a full-stack developer proficient in web development technologies and Linux operating systems. Currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at NYU. I have a deep interest in the intersection of technology, data, and real-world applications.

My hands-on experience is extensive and goes beyond just academic research. On my GitHub profile at [https://github.com/Jas000n](https://github.com/Jas000n), you can explore the actual code behind several of my projects (all accompanied by comprehensive READMEs in my Github repository), spanning various tech stacks and application scenarios. These projects not only showcase my coding skills but, more importantly, they stand as a testament to my exceptional capabilities as an engineer and my robust problem-solving prowess. I firmly believe in the transformative power of code and am always eager to embrace new challenges.

I'm actively seeking internship opportunities for 2024 summer, where I can apply my skills, learn, and contribute to impactful projects. With my rich hands-on experience and adept problem-solving capabilities, I'm confident that I would be a valuable asset to any team.
