In this comprehensive tutorial, I'll delve deep into the step-by-step process of setting up VMware on an Ubuntu system. Whether you're a beginner looking to explore the virtualization world or an experienced user aiming to streamline your workflow, this guide is tailored to ensure a smooth installation experience. By the end, you'll be well-equipped to harness the power of VMware on your Ubuntu machine.
## 0. Prerequisite
* System Compatibility: 

VMware Workstation requires a 64-bit processor and 64-bit host operating system.
* Hardware Requirements: 
 
At the very least, you'll need a 1.3GHz or faster core speed, but a multi-core processor is recommended for best performance. Ensure you have adequate RAM (minimum 2GB, 4GB or more recommended) and around 1.5GB of available disk space for the application, plus **additional space for virtual machines**.


## 1. Download VMware & Ubuntu Iso
VMware offers VMware Workstation Player for non-commercial use, which is a great option if you're looking to explore its features without any financial commitments.

* Visit the Official VMware Website:
 
Navigate to VMware's official website to ensure you're getting the genuine software.

Click "Try Workstation 17 Player for Linux" and a '.bundle' file should be automatically downloaded.

* Visit Ubuntu Official Website for a Clean Iso

Select a Version you like, personally I recommend version with 'LTS' postfix, for it stands for 'Long Time Support'.

## 2. Install VMware

* Dependencies for Installation: 

Install gcc, Cmake, and vmware-modconfig
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install gcc
sudo apt install make
```

Then install VMware and compatible dependencies
```
chmod +x VMware-Workstation-Full-<version>.bundle
sudo ./VMware-Workstation-Full-<version>.bundle
sudo vmware-modconfig --console --install-all
```
Many online tutorials skip a vital configuration step when installing VMware on Ubuntu, leading to startup problems. Our guide emphasizes this critical configuration to ensure a hassle-free VMware experience.

## 3. Create New Virtual Machine
Once you've started VMware, initiate the creation of a new virtual machine. Make sure to select the ISO file you've recently downloaded as the source for the virtual machine installation.

## 4. Hello Ubuntu inside Another Ubuntu
Use 'Ctrl+Alt+T' to call out the terminal
```
echo "Hello, Ubuntu inside another Ubuntu!"
```
