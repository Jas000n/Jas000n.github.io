# BiliUp Automatic Recording and Posting Tool
Automatically records broadcasts from platforms and uploads to Bilibili

## 1. Installation
```shell
pip install biliup

pip install quickjs

sudo apt update && sudo apt install nodejs -y

```
## 2. Recording
Create Directory：
```shell
mkdir biliup_home

cd biliup_home

```
vim configuration file：
```shell
vim config.toml

```
Paste the following content：
```toml
# these are required fields
[streamers."1xx直播录像"] # streamer1
url = ["https://www.twitch.tv/1xx"]
tags = ["biliup"]

[streamers."2xx直播录像"] # streamer2
url = ["https://www.twitch.tv/2xx"]
tags = ["biliup"]
```
+ tags are the tags for the manuscript, which can be arbitrarily written, such as "Host Recording", "Hearthstone", etc., but must not exceed 12.
+ streamers is the name of the submission
+ url is the address of the live room

Start recording
```shell
biliup start
```
Check if the script is running correctly
```shell
ps -A |grep biliup #If the process is found, it is running successfully
```
## 3. Posting to BiliBili
Based on your machine, go tohttps://github.com/ForgQi/biliup-rs/releases to find the matching executable file

For example, my machine: Linux, x86_64

Download the file:
```shell 
wget https://github.com/ForgQi/biliup-rs/releases/download/v0.1.15/biliupR-v0.1.15-x86_64-linux.tar.xz
```
Extract：
```shell
tar -xvJf *.tar.xz
```
Login to get a cookie:

```shell
./biliup login
```
After the host finishes broadcasting, it will automatically post; make sure to place the cookie and config.toml in the same directory.
